'''
This exercise will teach you about how to interact with lists, for loops, representing strings as lists and how to sort lists.

TODO:
- You have been given 2 lists, one with numbers and one with fruit.
- 1) turn fruit from ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"] to ["banana", "apple", "orange", "pear"] (banana & apple swapped positions) with indexing
- 2) print the smallest and largest number in the numbers list using a for loop
- 3) repeat 2) but use inbuilt functions with lists. Google them
- 4) sort the numbers list in ascending order (look up bubblesort, i'll go through this with you)
- 5) repeat 4) but use inbuilt functions with lists. Google them
- 6) use for loops to count how many letter "a"'s exist in fruits (use inbuilt function .count("name"))
