#What are the best ways to search something in a list how does a dictionary work?
#Why do we need to search stuff (databases?)
#Finding the maximum value in a list
def max(list1):
    max=list1[0] #intialising as the first 
    for i in range(len(list1)): #search len() function
        #we will use list indexing, using numbers to go through all the elements in the list
        #Type here
    return max
#Use the max function on the following list
lst=[4,34,31,67,983,22,13,46,100,9431,11]
#Use the code above to write a min function
def min(list1):
    min=list1[0] #intialising as the first 
    for i in range(len(list1)): #search len() function
        #we will use list indexing, using numbers to go through all the elements in the list
        #Type here
    return min
#Use the min function on the list above
lst=[4,34,31,67,983,22,13,46,100,9431,11]
#How would you find the min or max on a sorted list? How long will it take?
#Type here:
#Is it easier to find a value in a sorted list??
#Can you make a function to find a certain value in a list. Is sorted list easier?
#How can you make your algorithm faster?
